a.
same result. the in-order traversal for every tree.
results are all the same {1 3 5 7 9 11}
b.
because tree->list-1 and tree->list-2 use differen implementations, their run-time may be different, tree->list-1
uses append, and tree->list-2 uses only cons. so tree->list-1 has an O(nlgn) complexity, and O(n) for tree->list-2.
