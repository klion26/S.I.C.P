Trigonometric Functions
Scheme always uses radians for its internal representation of angles, so its sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent functions operate as such:
(sin x)
(cos x)
(tan x)
(asin x)
(acos x)
(atan x)

Hyperbolic Functions
Scheme provides a number of hyperbolic functions, such as hyperbolic sine, cosine, tangent and their inverses.
(sinh x) 
(cosh x)
(tanh x)
(asinh x)
(acosh x)
(atanh x)

Power Functions
(expt a b) => a^b
(sqrt x) == (expt x 0.5)
Exponential and logarithmic functions
(exp x) => e^x
(log x) => log{e}{x}

Other useful maths functions (rounding, modulo, gcd, etc.)
(floor x) - This returns the largest integer that is no larger than x.
(ceiling x) - This returns the smallest integer that is no smaller than x.
(truncate x) - This returns the integer value closest to x that is no larger than the absolute value of x.
(round x) - This rounds value of x to the nearest integer as is usual in mathematics. It even works when halfway between values.
(abs x) - This returns the absolute value of x.
(remainder x y) =>Calculates the remainder of dividing y into x (that is, the remainder of x/y):
(modulo x y) => Calculates the modulo of x and y.
