solution:
(define (nth-root x n)  ;;;get the nth-root of x
  (fixed-point
     ((repeated average-damp 7)  ;;;repeat 7 times average-damp, we could modify this
        (lambda (y) (/ x (expt y (- n 1)))))
     1.0))

sqrt, 3th-root, .... 7th-root only need a single average-damp
from 8th-root to 15th-root we need two average-damps
from 16th-root to 31th-root we need 3 average-damps
32th-root to 63th-root we need 4 average-damps

we need max(floor(log(n)/log(2)) - 1, 0) average-damps
